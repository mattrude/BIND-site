title: Reset ALL RRD Graphs

Today at 11:04pm CST I was forced to reset the RRD graphs due to corruption in the data set.

Due to this change, all graphs will show zero responses prior to 23:05 on 2017-03-01.

This change will not effect any DNS traffic and only affects the reporting graph statistics shown on this site.
